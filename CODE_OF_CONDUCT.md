# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As members, contributors, and leaders of this project, we are committed to fostering a community that is welcoming, respectful, and free from harassment for everyone. We value diversity and inclusivity, regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity or expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We strive to create an environment where everyone feels safe to participate, share ideas, and collaborate.

## Community Standards

Positive behaviors that help build a healthy community include:

- Showing empathy and kindness to others
- Respecting different opinions, backgrounds, and experiences
- Offering and accepting constructive feedback graciously
- Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community over individual interests

Behaviors that are not acceptable in our community include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting, or making derogatory comments
- Harassment, whether public or private
- Sharing someone else’s private information without consent
- Any conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Leadership Responsibilities

Project leaders are responsible for clarifying and upholding these standards. They may take any action they deem appropriate in response to unacceptable behavior, including editing or removing comments, code, or other contributions, and communicating reasons for moderation when necessary.

## Where This Applies

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, both online and offline, and to anyone representing the project in public spaces. Representation includes using an official project email, posting from official accounts, or acting as a delegate at events.

## Reporting Issues
